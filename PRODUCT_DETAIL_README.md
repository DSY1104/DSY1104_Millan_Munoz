# Product Detail Implementation

## Overview

The Product Detail page has been successfully migrated from the old vanilla JavaScript implementation to React. It includes full product information display, reviews system, cart integration, and social sharing capabilities.

## Route

- **URL Pattern**: `/products?code={productCode}` or `/products?id={productCode}`
- Both query parameters (`code` and `id`) are supported for backward compatibility.

## Components

### Main Component

- **File**: `/src/pages/ProductDetail.jsx`
- **Description**: Main product detail page component that orchestrates all sub-components and manages the product state.

### Sub-Components (in same file)

#### 1. ProductDetail

Displays product information, quantity selector, add to cart button, and share options.

**Features**:

- Product image with fallback
- "Agotado" (Out of Stock) badge
- Product metadata (name, brand, price, rating)
- Specifications list
- Quantity selector with stock validation
- Add to cart button with feedback animation
- Social share buttons (Web Share API + Facebook/Twitter/WhatsApp)

#### 2. ReviewsSection

Container for all review-related components.

**Features**:

- Reviews header with average rating and count
- Reviews list
- Review form (conditional rendering based on auth state)

#### 3. ReviewItem

Individual review display component.

**Features**:

- User name and review date
- Star rating display
- Verified purchase badge
- Review comment

#### 4. ReviewForm

Form for submitting new reviews.

**Features**:

- Comment textarea (10-300 characters)
- Character counter with warning states
- Form validation
- Submit button with loading state
- Login prompt for unauthenticated users
- "Already reviewed" message for users who have reviewed

## Custom Hook: useReviews

**Purpose**: Manages all review-related logic using localStorage.

**Methods**:

- `getProductReviews(code)`: Retrieves all reviews for a product
- `addReview(code, review)`: Adds a new review for a product
- `getProductRatingStats(code)`: Calculates average rating and distribution
- `hasUserReviewed(code, userEmail)`: Checks if user has already reviewed
- `generateMockReviews(code, count)`: Creates mock reviews for testing (runs automatically)

**Storage**: Uses localStorage with key `"productReviews"` in format:

```json
{
  "JM001": [
    {
      "id": "1234567890",
      "rating": 5,
      "comment": "Excellent product!",
      "userName": "John D.",
      "userEmail": "john@example.com",
      "date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "verified": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Helper Functions

### 4. Authentication Integration

- Uses `useAuth` context

### 5. Social Sharing

- Web Share API (native sharing on mobile)

  - Star selection (1-5)
  - Comment (10-300 chars)
  - Character counter
  - Form validation

## Data Flow

1. **Page Load**:

   - Read `code` or `id` from URL query parameters
   - Fetch product data using `getProductByCode()`
   - If product not found, redirect to `/products`
   - Generate mock reviews if none exist

2. **User Actions**:
   - **Click Product Card**: Navigate to `/products?code={code}`
   - **Change Quantity**: Validate against stock, show errors
   - **Add to Cart**: Call `addToCart()`, show success animation
   - **Submit Review**: Validate form, save to localStorage, refresh list
   - **Share**: Use Web Share API or open social media share URL

## Integration Points

### Services

- `/src/services/catalogService.js`: `getProductByCode(code)`

### Hooks

- `/src/hooks/useCart.js`: `addToCart()`
- `/src/hooks/useAuth.js`: Via `useAuth()` context

### Context

- `/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`: Authentication state and modals

### Updated Components

- `/src/components/products/ProductCard.jsx`: Added click navigation to product detail

## CSS

- **File**: `/src/styles/pages/product-detail.css`
- Includes styles for product detail card, reviews section, review form, and all sub-components
- Responsive design with mobile breakpoints

## Routing

The route is configured in `/src/App.jsx` but uses query parameters:

```jsx
<Route path="/product/:id" element={<ProductDetailPage />} />
```

Note: The component reads from query parameters (`?code=` or `?id=`), so both routes work:

- `/products?code=JM001`
- `/products?id=JM001`
